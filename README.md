Ellen White Bible Commentary
There are multiple Bible commentaries out there. This module features Bible commentary from an inspired writer, Ellen White. For most of the Bible Ellen White has poignant, inspired commentary on texts of Scripture. The module has the ability to map Bible verses to inspired, succinct Ellen White commentary. The module has a search engine: an auto-complete feature that lists all biblical verses which user chooses, conducting a search in attempt to list all Ellen White commentaries/references that are applicable to the chosen text of Scripture. Note, Ellen White has a very large commentary of Scripture but it is not exhaustive.

Hint, the module also offers Ellen White commentary on a chapter level in the Bible (ex. Genesis 1): enter a zero in the verse field on the form and all the Ellen White Bible commentaries on the entire chapter will be returned, if they exists.
